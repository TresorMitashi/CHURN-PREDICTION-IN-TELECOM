# CHURN-PREDICTION-IN-TELECOM
# 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
1.1. Churn Problem
Understanding the problem of churn prediction in the telecom industry is crucial for developing an effective solution. below is more detailed breakdown of what we should consider when understanding the problem:

1.2. Define Churn
Churn could be when a customer cancels their subscription, switches to another provider, or significantly reduces their usage of telecom services. Clearly defining churn will guide your analysis and model development.

1.3. Business Impact
Churn not only results in revenue loss but also affects customer acquisition costs and brand reputation. Quantify the financial implications of churn to emphasize its importance to stakeholders.

1.4. Identify Key Stakeholders
This could include telecom executives, marketing teams, customer service representatives, and data analysts. Understand their perspectives and requirements to tailor your solution accordingly.

1.5. Data Availability
Identify the sources of data, such as customer databases, call detail records (CDRs), billing systems, and customer service logs. Determine if you have access to historical churn data and other relevant variables.

1.6. Customer Behavior
Understand why customers churn, whether it's due to dissatisfaction with service quality, pricing issues, better offers from competitors, or other factors.

1.7. Temporal Dynamics
Recognize that churn prediction in the telecom industry often involves temporal dynamics. Customer behavior and churn patterns may change over time, influenced by factors such as promotional offers, network performance, and market competition.

1.8. Benchmarking
Understand what methods and metrics are commonly used, as well as the challenges and best practices associated with churn prediction.

# 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
2.1 Background
In the highly competitive telecom industry, retaining customers is essential for sustaining profitability and maintaining market share. Customer churn, defined as the loss of customers to competitors or discontinuation of services, poses a significant challenge for telecom companies. Identifying customers at risk of churn and implementing proactive retention strategies is crucial for minimizing revenue loss and maximizing customer lifetime value.

2.1 Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn in a telecom company. By leveraging historical customer data and predictive analytics, the model aims to identify customers who are likely to churn in the near future, enabling the company to take preemptive measures to retain them.

# 3. IMPLEMENTATION
To provide a comprehensive implementation of the metrics, algorithms, and techniques for churn prediction, we'll cover the following aspects:

Metrics: We'll implement metrics to evaluate the performance of the churn prediction model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.

Algorithms: We'll implement machine learning algorithms commonly used for churn prediction, we will use logistic regression, random forests and support_vector_machine.

Techniques: We'll implement data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning (if it is necessary)
